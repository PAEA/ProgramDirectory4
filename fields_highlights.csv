Our goal is to foster an academic environment that encourages the process of inquiry and the scientific method of problem solving. While much of the first two years of school is focused on basic science education, students interact with patients very early inthe curriculum. The program is organized so that dental students function as assistants in their first year and hygienists in their second year; the third and fourth years are devoted to comprehensive care of patients. Specialty electives are available in the fourth year for students who progress briskly through the curriculum. The school emphasizes progressive education techniques, which include traditional lectures, small-group interactions, problem-based learning and a systems-based basic science education. ",Yes"A.T. Still University, Arizona School of Dentistry & Oral Health","The curriculum at the Arizona School of Dentistry & Oral Health is designed to produce graduates who are technologically adept, professionally competent, patient-centered and compassionate. The curriculum emphasizes patientcare experiences through simulation, integration of biomedical and clinical sciences and problem-solving scenarios to achieve clinical excellence. The curriculum includes a strong component of public health, leadership and practice through weekly learning modules. Students have the opportunity to interactwith faculty, practicing dentists and national leaders to discuss cases in a regularly scheduled “grand rounds” format.",Yes"Midwestern University College of Dental Medicine-Arizona","The curriculum emphasizes integrated disciplines that both enhance learning and fully prepare students to practice general dentistry providing total patient care.The basic science curriculum is organized by body systems, rather than by biomedical discipline, and spans five academic quarters. This systems-based approach, combined with clinical case studies, improves the learning experience for entry to patient care and prepares students for Part I of the National Dental Board Examination.The preclinical curriculum is organized by tooth segments, rather than by dental disciplines. This highly integrated coursework spans six academic quarters of instruction in the simulation laboratory, emphasizing competency in a wide variety of clinical procedures. The coursework stresses patient simulation, technical quality, high efficiency and self-assessment. Students begin clinical care on a limited basis in the second year.The foundation of the clinical curriculum in the third and fourth academic years rests in the practice of general dentistry organized in practice groups led by general dentist faculty members. This eight-quarter curriculum emphasizes comprehensive patient-centered care, competency of all students in a full range of patient care services, and practice management and efficiency.The curriculum also prepares students for Part II of the National Board Dental Examination and clinical licensure examinations.",YesHerman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC,"The curricular goals are the following:1. To use student-centered, inquiry-based methods in all aspects of basic, preclinical and clinical science instruction throughout all four years that will encourage students to develop lifelong problem-solving and group learning skills.2. To encourage students to question materials presented and to develop a collegial interaction with the faculty—all areas of instruction occur in a professional atmosphere, and there is no activity that demeans students or creates an atmosphere in which student inquiry is repressed.3. To vertically integrate the curriculum so that all three sciences and clinical skills are organized to emphasize the direct relevance of basic science learning outcomes to clinical problems.4. To develop dental graduates who are:›› Dedicated to lifelong, self-motivated learning.›› Accomplished in the methods required to solve problems in a clinical setting.›› Able to effectively understand and respond to changes in the profession.",Yes"Loma Linda University School of Dentistry","LLUSD’s program is a traditional dental curriculum with emphasis in clinical training. Graduates are skilled in providing quality dental care that is comprehensive in its scope and preventive in its goals.• Year 1: Basic sciences with introduction to clinical sciences.• Year 2: Applied sciences and introduction to clinical practice.• Year 3: Clinical sciences with extensive patient contact.• Year 4: Delivery of comprehensive dental care.",Yes"University of California, Los Angeles, School of Dentistry","The goals of the program are to prepare reflective practitioners who:1. Possess the knowledge and skills necessary to provide patients with comprehensive dental care.2. View their role in the profession from a humanitarian perspective.3. Are able to provide socially sensitive and responsible leadership in the community.4. Continuously update their knowledge, techniques and practices.The length of the D.D.S. program is 45 months. The curriculum uses lectures, small groupdiscussion, labs, CD-ROMs and web-based resources. Students supplement their educationalexperience through a variety of electives including teaching apprenticeships, mentoredresearch projects, leadership training and volunteer service at UCLA-sponsored outreachclinics. Early entry into the clinic is a priority. Student dentists, organized in vertical-tierteams, provide comprehensive care to an assigned patient pool, supplemented by rotations tospecialty and community clinics.",Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
