successful completion of prerequisite courses for dentistry admissions requires a minimum grade of B or 74.5% based on the Ontario Medical Schools Application Services (OMSAS) scale for applicants studying at a Canadian university. Western will convert grades and averages for applicants who are not studying in a Canadian university based on grading practices and grading scale interpretation of institutions attended.
